The items are from the ipip (Goldberg, 1999). The data are from the SAPA project (Revelle, Wiltand Rosenthal, 2010),
collected Spring, 2010(https://www.sapa-project.org/).

\description{
This dataset includes 25 self-report personality items sourced from the International Personality Item Pool
(ipip.ori.org) as part of the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA) web-based personality
assessment project. The dataset contains responses from 2,800 examinees. Additionally, three
demographic variables (sex, education, and age) are included.
}
\details{
The 25 items are organized by five factors: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion,
Neuroticism, and Openness. The scoring key is created using \code{make.keys}, and scores are
calculated using \code{score.items}. These factors are useful for IRT-based latent factor analysis
of the polychoric correlation matrix. Endorsement plots and item information functions reveal
variations in item quality. Responses were collected on a 6-point scale:
1 = Very Inaccurate, 2 = Moderately Inaccurate, 3 = Slightly Inaccurate, 4 = Slightly Accurate,
5 = Moderately Accurate, 6 = Very Accurate, as part of the Synthetic Aperture Personality Assessment (SAPA)
project (https://www.sapa-project.org/). For examples of data collection techniques, visit
https://www.sapa-project.org/ or the International Cognitive Ability Resource at
https://icar-project.org. The items were sampled from the International Personality Item Pool of
Lewis Goldberg using SAPA sampling techniques. This dataset is a sample from the larger SAPA data bank.
